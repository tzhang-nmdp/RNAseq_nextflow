AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> RAP1_UNINDUCED_REP1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	2123	AGATCGGAAGAGC	50000	4.25
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	50000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	50000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 2123). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 0)
