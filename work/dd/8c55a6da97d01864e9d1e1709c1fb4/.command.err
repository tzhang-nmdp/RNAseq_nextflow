Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.4
single-core operation.

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> RAP1_UNINDUCED_REP2.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	3980	AGATCGGAAGAGC	100000	3.98
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	100000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	100000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 3980). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
